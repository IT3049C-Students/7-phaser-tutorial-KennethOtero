- [x] setup github pages for this project
- [x] submit the repository link on Canvas

## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:

I'd give myself 17/20 points for this assignment. The only reason is because the hosted GitHub page fails to load 
any of the scripts, but it works fine on my local machine. Maybe a server issue?

## Self-Reflection:

This assignment really showed me just how complex a little game can be, and that the Phaser engine is a great resource for creating cool, retro games like this one.

### How long it took me to finish this?

It took me around 2-3 hours to finish this assignment.
